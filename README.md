# Simulation-of-Taj-Mahal
A 3D simulation of Taj Mahal created using OpenGL.

This project leverages the capabilities of OpenGL to develop a visually stunning and interactive 3D model of the Taj Mahal. By employing various rendering techniques, such as texture mapping, lighting, and shading, the simulation aims to provide a realistic representation of the monument.
